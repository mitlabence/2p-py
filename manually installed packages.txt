Tips for pycharm:
create a conda environment using 2p-py-env.txt. It will install almost all packages except the list below.
Set this to the project interpreter in PyCharm. It might still run the default anaconda interpreter, and throw errors while importing stuff. Set the correct interpeter in the project configurations!


pip install pyabf  (2.3.7)
pip install pims_nd2  (1.1)

Other:
Install matlab engine for python. See Test Matlab Integration notebook.
ffmpeg needs to be installed for exporting videos. (e. g. Play nd2 along LFP, movement.ipynb). conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
	This is only the python package, though. Need to install the appropriate version from here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
	One version that worked was: ffmpeg version 4.3.2-2021-02-20-full_build-www.gyan.dev. I.e. full build built by gyan should work. Download the 7z file, 
	use 7-zip to extract it to an appropriate place (like C:\\ffmpeg. Warning: if extracted in Program Files, there will be a lot of issues with permissions!
	Even extracting there does not work easily). Then add the bin folder to the Path environmental variable (Edit the system environment variables). 
	Need to restart the prompt (Anaconda prompt) afterwards! Run ffmpeg and see if it works. If yes, ffmpeg should be installed. 
	Test the python library too (import ffmpeg) before using it.
