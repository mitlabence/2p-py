Export in a cross-platform compatible way:
conda env export --from-history>env.yml

platform + package specific:
conda env export ENVNAME>env.yml

platform + package + channel specific:
conda list --explicit>env.yml

% UPDATE 2023.08.03:
none of the above methods seem to work. conda env export seems to just export the folder of the environment.
The conda list --explicit cannot be read by conda create.

Two ways:
1. Using Anaconda Navigator: backup the selected environment. 
	Then use Navigator Import on the file to install the environment. Pip failed will appear for pip packages, install them manually later.
2. conda list --name <env-name> --export > <export_fname>.txt
	Then use conda create
