pip install pims_nd2
pip install pyabf

error upon trying "import pims_nd2" or "import pims":
OSError: [WinError 14001] The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail
(solution from https://www.majorgeeks.com/content/page/solved_the_application_has_failed_to_start_because_its_side_by_side_configuration_is_incorrect_error.html)
To make sure the issue is a missing Microsoft Visual C++ redistribution, check (on Windows 10):
1.
(this is less probably the source of the error)
Start (Win + S) -> Registry Editor -> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > SideBySide > Winners > x86_policy.9.0.microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_none_02d0010672fd8219 > 9.0
"That second to last long entry could vary from computer to computer, but it is the only key with 9.0 and crt in the string."
Look at the Default entry, compare it with the name of the other entries. The highest version number entry should be the value of Default.

2.
Start (Win + S) -> Event viewer -> Custom Views: look at all the Administrative Events. You should find the error with source SideBySide. Click on it. An example message:
Activation context generation failed for "C:\Users\Bence\anaconda3\envs\py2p\lib\site-packages\pims_nd2\ND2SDK\win\x64\v6_gnr_picture.dll". 
Dependent Assembly Microsoft.VC90.OpenMP,
	processorArchitecture="amd64",
	publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b",
	type="win32",
	version="9.0.21022.8" could not be found. Please use sxstrace.exe for detailed diagnosis.

Here one must confirm that indeed pims_nd2 has a problem (it is obvious from the path in the error text). So the correct error was located.
Next, Microsoft.VC90 refers to VC++. Then, the version is important: here, 9.0.21022.8 refers to version 9. This is an old version (no longer supported),
but one can still download (2023 September) the x86 and x64 versions (both needed) from here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022
As of now, the downloadable version is 9.0.30729.5677. It should work nevertheless.

Check in the anaconda prompt where jupyter-notebook is running. It should say something like this:
"Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error***
The HDF5 header files used to compile this application do not match
the version used by the HDF5 library to which this application is linked.
Data corruption or segmentation faults may occur if the application continues.
This can happen when an application was compiled by one version of HDF5 but
linked with a different version of static or shared HDF5 library.
You should recompile the application or check your shared library related
settings such as 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.
You can, at your own risk, disable this warning by setting the environment
variable 'HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK' to a value of '1'.
Setting it to 2 or higher will suppress the warning messages totally.
